Observations from data analysis

Per person, women spend more on the game than men do, however they only make up 14% of the player base. They also tend to purchase more evpensive items.

Most of our players are in the 20-24 age range and each person in that age group spends more on average than those in the adjacent age groups

The two age groups that spend the most on the game per person is the under 10 group and the 35-39 age group. This could be because the 35-39 group has good paying jobs and the under 10 group are spending their parents money and do not care as much about what they spend. It is possible that the two brackets contain parents and their kids, who may play together, which would encourage more spending on the game in the two age groups
